Architectural Todos
- Decide if I should switch to Python3?
    - Seems pretty straight forward
    - Python 2 is no longer supported...
    - https://gist.github.com/azidanit/9950aa5408acdbe25f0ec431654da8d6
- Stanley controller node
    - output should be desired speed and PWM - output both!
        - would be nice to have it only output one but you need current speed to set the PWM
        - car simulator takes in desired speed
        - EPS32 takes in PWM
        - plot the path
- keyboard controller node
    - control the car and take over RC control
- state estimation node
- pull optimized track from file
    - work with britton to identify preferred format
- PWM -> acceleration estimator (can be offline)


Big Todos
- Stanley controller node
    - pull controller input from params
- get the aceinna ins working!
- ESP32_Interface
    - Make this auto-calibrate so that it knows the mean PWM values and range
- Plot path to rviz using marker arrays
    - show centerline and edges
    - show planned path (possibly as a path msg?)
    - make RVIZ center on car frame in moving world
    - launch RVIZ from launch file with config file

Convenient Todos
- car_simulator/car_simulator_node
    - convert between PWM and car car_simulator input values in a better way
        - Right now I linearly interpolate PWM between 1000 to 2000 PW and car state expects -9.81 to 3.3 m/s^2
- car_simulator/car_simulator_node
    - in gnss publisher I currently do not publish lat/lon. Write a conversion piece around lat/lon
    - in map_received_speed_to_car I currently get accel desired by dividing by 1s - this was chosen arbitrarily

Completed Todos:
- General
    - ROS python cannot find Pandas
- car_simulator/car_simulator_node
    - setup param files to read in the car's description and location (for generating gnss lat/lon)
    - verify the car will move with some inputs
- Stanley controller node
    - verify import track
    - verify pandas in python 2.7 does all functions of track (not supported anymore)
    - set up publisher and subscriber
        - pub out commands
        - sub in pose and speed
    - car_simulator_node
        - publishing in a steering command does NOT change the steering angle - always fixed at hardest left turn (I think Left)
    - move over and test controller
        - test speed controller works
        - test steering controller works
        - test combined controller works
        - test it follows tracks
- General
    - launch file to launch everything
        - multiple nodes and the param files
- ESP32_Interface/PWM_Measure.msg
    - add std_msgs/Header to include time stamp. This might already be "done" but cmake was acting weird between catkin_make and VS code cmake leading to clock skewing
- ESP32_Interface/PWM_CMD.msg
    - add std_msgs/Header to include time stamp. This might already be "done" but cmake was acting weird between catkin_make and VS code cmake leading to clock skewing
